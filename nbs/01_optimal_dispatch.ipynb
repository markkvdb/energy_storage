    "Electricity is sold on the day-ahead market. Sellers and buyers submit their bids for the coming day before noon on a given day. A seller of electricity sells energy for each hour of the next day and receives a compensation for that based on the day-ahead (spot) price of that given day. If there's a mismatch between the amount of electricity that the seller sold and what the seller actually delivered, then the seller receives or pays a compensation based on the imbalance price. The seller receives a compensation if the seller produced more energy than what was sold and pays a compensation in case more energy was sold than delivered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional power plants are controllable (to different degrees) whereas photovoltaïc (and wind) assets are mostly dependent on weather conditions (and therefore uncontrollable). This uncontrollability can bring significant uncertainty to the revenue of these renewable assets. \n",
    "\n",
    "In case of photovoltaïc plants, there are two main issues contributing to financial risk. First, many European countries now have a significant portion of their total energy production sourced from photovoltaïc assets (>10%). As a result, moments of high photovoltaïc energy production increasingly result in downward pressure on the day-ahead prices due to higher energy supply resulting in lower revenues. Second, renewable energy, unlike traditional power plants, are mostly uncontrollable since energy production is driven by weather conditions. Because of this, estimating the energy to be sold on the day-ahead market has higher risks of large imbalance costs, since production is driven by uncontrollable factors and therefore has to be forecasted.\n",
    "\n",
    "One solution to potentially reduce the finanical risks from the two before-mentioned issues is to combine photovoltaïc assets with energy storage solutions to have more control on when energy is dispatched to the electricity grid. Energy storage could mitigate the risk of the lower prices on hours of high production by dispatching the energy to the grid on hours with higher prices. Batteries could as well mititage some of the incurred imbalance costs by rebalancing the energy returned to the grid such that the sold energy at each hour more closely matches the actual energy returned to the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Section 2, we will discuss how batteries could help with dispatching energy to the grid to sell this energy at higher prices. In Section 3, we introduce an extension to the analysis in Section 2 by investigating the higher inherit imbalance risks for photovoltaïc assets."
